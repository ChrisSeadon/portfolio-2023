<h2 className='text-center'> CS2 Skin Scraper in Python </h2>

Recently a friend of mine has been trying to aggregate up-to-date prices of all of the gun skins
in Counter Strike 2, and floated the idea of using Python to scrape the data from the site <a href="https://csgostash.com/">CSGOStash.com</a>.
I thought I'd give him a helping hand and put something together using Python and the 'BeautifulSoup4' library.

Quite a simple program that just grabs the info and dumps it into a .json file for use elsewhere.

The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ChrisSeadon/py-csgostash-scraper">here,</a> in a repo hosted on GitHub.

Could be helpful to somebody!
