<h2 className='text-center'>Unity 2D Game Kit - Sound Redesign</h2>

Ah, sound design. Like a warm blanket a winter's day, there to comfort you when you need a break from hours of game logic programming and swearing at your monitor.

I'm writing this article from a retrospective point of view, as this is a project I did back in late 2021 as a part of my Music degree. An elective module called 'Interactive Audio' I opted to take part in which
saw me doing sound design on a larger scale than I'd ever done before, as at that time the most I'd done was a few sounds for a small game jam game I did a few years before which was all of about two minutes long.

Here I designed and implemented SFX into the Unity '2D Game Kit' demo project, creating sounds using foley recording, synthesis and everything inbetween. Looking back now it's definitely not perfect --
but for my first project of this of scope up against a deadline I'm still quite proud of bits of it, particulary the sounds of the final boss fight, which was a mixture of synthesised laser and electricity sounds
as well as makeshift recordings of the heaviest objects I could find (I seem to recall both an office chair and an air conditioner) slamming against the floor to create those boomy footsteps.

You can see a snippet of the final result below.
