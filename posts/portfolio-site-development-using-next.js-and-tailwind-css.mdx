<h2 className='text-center'> Portfolio Site Development using Next.js and Tailwind CSS </h2>

Slowly but surely, I'm getting to grips with designing sites using React. I started the site you're browsing now in August 2023, and after a brief hiatus I'm finally finishing that now (Februrary, 2024).

The site will serve as both an example of web development skills I've learnt - such as the dynamic loading of posts from markdown files and UI elements that scale nicely with as many screen sizes as possible - as well as a
place for me to dump any of all progress and thoughts on projects I'm working on at a given moment in time. 

I chose Next due to some past experience, when I had a go at running an e-commerce site with Medusa JS. What I noticed when initially playing with it and again while developing it is that Next, in contrast to some
other React frameworks I've dabbled with seems to just... work? The other day I needed to update Node and Next to make a certain feature on the site work - and even after a change in a *major* version number after the
update, the site was still in the development environment and compiling perfectly. I feel like that's quite a good indicator of its reliability overall.

Tailwind CSS is also a fantastic tool -- I've never been particulary confident with juggling hundreds of CSS classes and Tailwind just makes the whole thing trivial. If there's a problem with the scaling of anything on here,
I can happily admit that *I'm* the problem, and not the CSS framework. Not always the case and, again, gives me a lot of confidence in recommending it to anybody needing to design a great looking site without copy and pasting any
half-broken HTML off of Stackoverflow. I initially designed the site in Photoshop, and I was *easily* able to quickly make the mockup a reality here.

    alt='The original design of the site I mocked up in Photoshop'
    width={600}
    height={300}
    className="object-fit justify-center mx-auto"
/>

At the end of the day the site should (hopefully) speak for itself -- it's fairly basic, yes, but it does everything that I set out for it to do. With any luck it's a base that I can build off of for a few years to come.
