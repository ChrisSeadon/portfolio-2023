# Chris Seadon

A portfolio site by [Chris Seadon](cseadonproductions.co.uk) built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This is where I post any and all projects and past freelance work, as well as generally ramble about nothing where necessary. It's a bit of a sandbox for me to learn React and CSS concepts so don't expect the code to be beautiful -- it's very much a work in progress although as we all know these kinds of projects are rarely 'finished'.
