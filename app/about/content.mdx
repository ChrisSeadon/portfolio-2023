I'm a bit of a jack of all trades - a music making, camera working programmer based in the UK. I like to get involved in all sorts of creative projects, whether it's something I've dreamt
up myself or helping fellow creatives in behind-the-scenes knob twisting wizardry. This site will document such projects and occasionally perhaps give me somewhere to rant and discuss any of the
other hobbies I find myself getting lost in.
