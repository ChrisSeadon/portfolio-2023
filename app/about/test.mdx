<h2 className="text-center"> Perfectionism: The Problems with Producing Your Own Music </h2>

Music, as well as most creative works, really works better when it's people coming together and bouncing ideas off of each other. It wasn't *The Beatle*, nor *The Kink* (why does that sound so much dodgier?) -- and even the hundreds of successful solo artists are almost always backed by a record producer, or in the case of pop music the famous 'Swedish Songwriters'. When those aren't in the picture I'll still hedge my bets that that artist would run their songs by fellow musicians, best mates or probably their mums. I'm sure it's not always the case, but my point is that if you've ever tried to write, record and release music on your own: it's difficult.

This is more of a personal rant than some kind of lesson on the history of music and self-made artists. I started playing the guitar when I was 14, graduated from a degree in music production at 20 -- and I write loads of songs. Sometimes in the dead of night, sometimes in the shower, melodies and lyrics and chord sequences and drum fills take over my thoughts and I write it as it comes. The lyrics are the most difficult thing to get right, but gradually you get used to rhymes and near-rhymes you can get away with and how many syllables you can cram into a phrase -- and after a few years the lyrics you write start to get less generic (or downright embarrassing) and closer to something you genuinely connect with.

So you’d think, with all that songwriting, I must have released countless songs - no? 

Not quite. My issue continues to be that I’m a perfectionist at heart and whatever I make is never *quite* what I envisioned. And even though the reality is that it never will be, that doesn’t stop me from toiling over the same song for months or years and never quite getting it finished.

It’s easy to kid yourself that the reason for this is about not having the guitar you want, or an expensive microphone in a great space with a lovely preamp. But after years of obsessing over that stuff – less chasing a certain sound and more as a slightly worrying, addictive hobby – it hasn’t really gotten me any closer to getting to that perfection that I’m looking for. I’m a sound engineer, and I know how to get the sounds I want. The unfortunate reality is that that perfection I’m always striving for?

It doesn’t really exist at all. 

Which brings me back to the idea of working with other people. The things that I have finished in the past few years have always been projects with friends, as well as any and all work I’ve done as a producer on other people’s music. As soon as you have somebody to bounce ideas off of, and to give you that reassurance that yes, that does actually sound amazing and it seems like we’re done, things go a lot more smoothly.
